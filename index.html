    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside of the mystery black box, there is not a system involving tubes leading the input water to buckets.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>Within the blackbox, there is a funnel at the top as well as a tube coming out. When water is poured in the top, varying amounts of water come out. To attempt figuring out the mechanisms inside, we poured water into the black box at varying rates, and observed how the amount of water that came out varies. Within our model, we included buckets to collect some of the water in order to mimic the results of the real box. To test our model, we poured in specific amounts of water, and record how much would come out. To keep the experiment valid, we poured the same amount in on each trial: 200mL. Though we did get some varying results, first 0mL then 12.5mL and then a few trials ranging in the 20mL range, this does not mean that our design is the one inside. We did not account for lost water, and our model does not have the capability to dump out over twice as much water as enters, a capability of the real box.  </p>
     <h3>Reasoning Part One</h3>
    <p>A model is a way of representing oneâ€™s ideas in the most palatable way possible: a physical representation of it. They are useful because of the way that it allows observers to view and interact with the components of a concept. A strength is that it allows one to visualize an idea really clearly. </p>
<h3>Reasoning Part Two</h3>
   <p>The results of our system were similar to those of the real box, however not consistently different enough amounts of output liquid came out to resemble conclude that our system is the same as the original. Another issue that comes up is that our system can not reproduce the large ratios of water in to water out that the original box did.<p>
  <h3>Reasoning Part Three</h3>
   <p>If our bucket and tube model was representative of the real box, we would have observed that after maximum 6 liters of liquid were poured in, the ratio between the input water and the output would become 1 to 1. This is because after a long time, no matter how big they are the buckets would fill up eventually. The data collected from the black box shows no sign of this, though, because even after a week of the box being used, the results still vary. Therefore, our model using the boxes to divert water can not be 100% representative of what is truly going on inside.<p>
