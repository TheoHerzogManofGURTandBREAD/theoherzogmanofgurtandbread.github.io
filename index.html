    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside of the mystery black box, there is not a system involving tubes leading the input water to buckets.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>Within the blackbox, there is a funnel at the top as well as a tube coming out. When water is poured in the top, varying amounts of water come out. To attempt figuring out the mechanisms inside, we poured water into the black box at varying rates, and observed how the amount of water that came out varies. Within our model, we included buckets to collect some of the water in order to mimic the results of the real box. To test our model, we poured in specific amounts of water, and record how much would come out. To keep the experiment valid, we poured the same amount in on each trial: 200mL. Though we did get some varying results, first 0mL then 12.5mL and then a few trials ranging in the 20mL range, this does not mean that our design is the one inside. We did not account for lost water, and our model does not have the capability to dump out over twice as much water as enters, a capability of the real box.  </p>
     <h1>Reasoning Part One </h1>
    <p>A model is a way of representing oneâ€™s ideas in the most palatable way possible: a physical representation of it. They are useful because of the way that it allows observers to view and interact with the components of a concept. A strength is that it allows one to visualize an idea really clearly. </p>
